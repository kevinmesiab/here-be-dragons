*Here Be The Dragons* or *"Dragons"* for short, aims to help increase the awesomeness of your geo related projects.  It is the parent project of a series of libraries and tools for developing or working with:

* Mobile and non mobile geo locating.
* Geographic and geospatial datasets.  
* Open Source mapping APIs.
* Geographically related public content 

Things You Should Know About Dragons:

* Probably be a half decent list of free public geo data.
* Otherwise, not really useful, yet. 
* Wants you to share useful, related, public data sets.
* Appreciates your interest.
* Welcomes your comments.

Current Status

* Project Phase: *Data Curation*
* Project Stability: *N/A*

* Wikipedia*  https://www.wikipedia.org 
Many of Wikipedia's articles are geo-tagged with their longitude and latitude.  You can use th public API to project this data onto 
Latitude and longitude coordinates as given in various Wikipedia articles, somewhat analogous to how ISBN numbers are handled.

WikiProject Geographical coordinates aims to better organize location information in articles containing a set of numbers that identifies location on and relative to the Earth. In particular, we aim to establish a standard for uniform handling of latitude

|Notability (geographic features) | Notability on Wikipedia is an inclusion criterion based on the encyclopedic suitability of an article topic. Per Wikipedia's Five pillars, the encyclopedia also functions as a gazetteer; therefore, geographical features meeting Wikipedia's General notability guideline (GNG) are presumed, but not guaranteed, to be notable. | [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(geographic_features)) |
